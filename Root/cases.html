                        <h3>Location: Los Angeles</h3>
                        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                        <p>The Los Angeles Connection is perhaps GREAT PRETENDER’s most simplistic arc. It takes the concept of “swindling” and presents it in a very straight-forward way, consisting of Edamame, Laurent, and Abby taking on the Hollywood mafia drug lord, Eddie Cassano. This is in contrast to later arcs, which don’t always unfold in the most predictable way – to results both good and bad.<br><br>

                            Case 1 is also GREAT PRETENDER’s most referential arc, taking all of the tropes of decadent Hollywood and mafia movies and dialling them up to eleven. It is also very aware of its links with Breaking Bad, even making reference to it at one point – if there is one thing that this show is not afraid of, it is wearing its influences on its sleeve.</p>

                            <p>Laurent takes on the role as a business partner of Eddie Cassano. He introduces the "Sakura Magic" drug made by the chemist Dr.Edmura from the Chemical Research Institute of Japan to Cassano.</p>
                            <p>The Sakura Magic he is selling to Cassano is not actually a drug, but ordinary candy from Japan. With his charisma, he uses the candy as a ploy in order to trick Cassano.</p>
                            <p>He manages to pique Cassano's interest, and came to a compromise. Cassano was willing to pay $5 million USD for the drug, but only if he witnesses Dr. Edmura producing the drug with his own eyes.</p>

                            <p>She plays a crucial role in this case as she performs a masterful act in manipulating Eddie into believing the credibility of the Sakura Magic.</p>

                            <p>Edamura was the only person amongst the con artists in this case who was the oblivious to the plan. He was forced to play the role of a chemist and is now improvising to the best of his ability in order to win against Laurent in a bet.</p>
                            <p>He was tasked with the insane job of producing Molly,a drug with a candy appearance similar to that of the Sakura Magic.</p>
                            <p>Edamura was coerced into cooperating with the FBI (Cynthia) and agreed to cooperate, on the condition that Salazer, the bodyguard of Cassano gets to run away from the life of crime and give him the opportunity to be a better father for his son Tom.</p>

                            <p>We are also introduced to Cynthia Moore during this case. Just like Edamura, we had no idea that she was in on the scam.</p>
                            <p>Cynthia pretends to be a member of the FBI by stealing the identity of the FBI agent Paula Dickins. With the authority as a (fake) FBI, she was able to call a raid on the drug factory to cease the production of the fake Magic Sakura as well as corner Eddie.</p>
                            <p>After his arresst, Eddie makes attempts at bribery. Cynthia accepts his deal of a whopping $100,000,000 USD, and then shortly after flees the country along with the rest of the crew.</p>

                        <h3>Location: Singapore</h3>
                        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                        <p>Two years after the Los Angeles Connection case, Makoto takes up an honest job as a mechanic, unknowing of how this ties in to the next con Laurent has planned. Makoto reunites with the rest of the crew, albeit reluctantly, after his boss from his previous job recommends that he be a mechanic for an air sports team. The con focuses on two princes, Sam and Clark Ibrahim, and the Pathfinder Air Race.</p>  
                        <p>Sam is the older brother to Clark and the president of the Pathfinder Air Race. Sam and his Brother were princes in a oil rich country. They then came up with a scheme to become rich. This scheme was to buy out the Pathfinder Air Race and rig it in Clark's favor while Sam does backhanded deals and the rigging. In this tournament, Abigail is the pilot for the crew's team but her mental state slowly deteriorates throughout the tournament as she starts remembering her traumatic past.</p>

                            <h3 style="font-family: marker;">Sam Ibrahim</h3>
                            <p>Sam is misogynistic and still adheres to old beliefs that women don't belong in certain fields like air racing. He is shrewd and calculating, easily seeing through Cynthia's guise. He is also cruel, hot-tempered, and is easily provoked by the failures of his underlings, being ready to kill them at the slightest failure.</p>

                            <p>Makoto turns himself in and was sentenced for 2 years in jail. During his sentence, he would be fortunate enough to have the opportunity to learn skills in order to reintegrate into society and earn an honest job.</p>
                            <p>Makoto decided that he wanted to become a mechanic and worked hard during his sentence and became an apprentice, working in Nakanoshima Heavy Industries. This workshop was owned by Shougo Nakanoshima, a mechanic that has a passion for airplanes.</p>
                            <p>Nakanoshima recommended Edamura get a job as mechanic for the up and coming 'Pathfinder Air Race' held in Singapore. It would turn out that the team he's working with is the crew of con-artist, who will be joining the tournament under the name 'Team Confidence'.</p>

                            <p>Sam Ibrahim was willing to sabotage the other racer's plane engine so his brother, Clark Ibrahim will win. In a previous tournament, Sam Ibrahim went as far as to cripple the former air racer, Lewis Mueller for defying his conditions.</p>
                            <p>Laurent was aware of the fact that Lewis had grown a strong hatred towards Sam Ibrahim because of his disgusting actions, so he decided to include him on the scheme to take down Sam. Lewis' wife mentioned how despite him getting crippled because of air racing, he still dreams of racing.</p>
                            <p>The crew plans on rigging the tournament by sabotaging plane engines just like Sam Ibrahim, to ensure that Abigail would make it to the finals to allow Lewis to get his rematch against Clark.</p>

                            <p>We learn that her hometown in Baghdad, Iraq was bombed by a fighter jet, who was piloted by non-other than Lewis Mueller. After that point in her life, she was enlisted in a militant group as a child soldier.</p>
                            <p>Abbie's trauma, began transforming into something a lot more violent and made an attempt to exact vengeance on Lewis, before being stopped by Edamura.</p>

                            <p>After Clark and Sam overhears a conversation between Makoto and Cynthia, they were baited into believing that Makoto was a top-notch mechanic who worked for Lewis when he was still racing which intrigued them.</p>
                            <p>They were willing to see just how good of a mechanic Makoto was by assessing his work and seeing the difference it would have on Clark's performance. After they tested the plane, Shi-won Kim a con-artist apart of the scheme informs Sam of an underground casino where they bet on the air races.</p>
                            <p>Sam knowing full well that he rigs his races, he ceases this opportunity to gain more cash, but this whole underground casino was just a ploy operated by the crew to manipulate Sam.</p>

                            <p>During the race, Clark eventually realises that the person he's up against is not Abbie, but Lewis. This fires him up as this was the rematch he was longing for and the intensity of the race elevates to another level. The two of them duke it out, performing wild maneuvers in the air and have an extremely close race.</p>
                            <p>Abigail watches as she clenches onto her old and damaged medal she won from a ballet tournament back in her youth. In this moment, Abbie thinks back to Lewis' apology and forgives Lewis for his actions. The race was extremely close, but Clark came out victorious.</p>
