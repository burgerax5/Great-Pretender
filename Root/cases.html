                <p>In Great Pretender, each arc is labelled as a case.
                    <br>
                    In each case, the crew targets corrupt people with money and power in an effort to swindle them for big cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watch as Edamura, Laurent, Abbie, Cynthia and their several associates make a fool of each and every target,
                    <br>
                    they set their eyes on.

                        <h3>Location: Los Angeles</h3>
                        <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                        <p>The Los Angeles Connection is perhaps GREAT PRETENDER’s most simplistic arc. It takes the concept of “swindling” and presents it in a very straight-forward way, consisting of Edamame, Laurent, and Abby taking on the Hollywood mafia drug lord, Eddie Cassano. This is in contrast to later arcs, which don’t always unfold in the most predictable way – to results both good and bad.<br><br>

                            Case 1 is also GREAT PRETENDER’s most referential arc, taking all of the tropes of decadent Hollywood and mafia movies and dialling them up to eleven. It is also very aware of its links with Breaking Bad, even making reference to it at one point – if there is one thing that this show is not afraid of, it is wearing its influences on its sleeve.</p>

                            <p>Laurent takes on the role as a business partner of Eddie Cassano. He introduces the "Sakura Magic" drug made by the chemist Dr.Edmura from the Chemical Research Institute of Japan to Cassano.</p>
                            <p>The Sakura Magic he is selling to Cassano is not actually a drug, but ordinary candy from Japan. With his charisma, he uses the candy as a ploy in order to trick Cassano.</p>
                            <p>He manages to pique Cassano's interest, and came to a compromise. Cassano was willing to pay $5 million USD for the drug, but only if he witnesses Dr. Edmura producing the drug with his own eyes.</p>

                            <p>We are first introduced to Abigail Jones inside Cassano's mansion. Abbie is disguised as one of the many woman amongst Eddie's harem. She pretends to be incapable of speaking English.</p>
                            <p>She plays a crucial role in this case as she performs a masterful act in manipulating Eddie into believing the credibility of the Sakura Magic.</p>

                            <p>Edamura was the only person amongst the con artists in this case who was the oblivious to the plan. He was forced to play the role of a chemist and is now improvising to the best of his ability in order to win against Laurent in a bet.</p>
                            <p>He was tasked with the insane job of producing Molly,a drug with a candy appearance similar to that of the Sakura Magic.</p>
                            <p>Edamura was coerced into cooperating with the FBI (Cynthia) and agreed to cooperate, on the condition that Salazer, the bodyguard of Cassano gets to run away from the life of crime and give him the opportunity to be a better father for his son Tom.</p>

                            <p>We are also introduced to Cynthia Moore during this case. Just like Edamura, we had no idea that she was in on the scam.</p>
                            <p>Cynthia pretends to be a member of the FBI by stealing the identity of the FBI agent Paula Dickins. With the authority as a (fake) FBI, she was able to call a raid on the drug factory to cease the production of the fake Magic Sakura as well as corner Eddie.</p>
                            <p>After his arresst, Eddie makes attempts at bribery. Cynthia accepts his deal of a whopping $100,000,000 USD, and then shortly fleeing the country along with the rest of the crew.</p>
