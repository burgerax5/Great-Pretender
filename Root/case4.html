                    <h2>CASE 4: Wizard of Far East</h2>

                    <h3>Location: Shanghai & Tokyo</h3>
                    <h3>Synopsis:</h3>
                    <p>Two years after the Los Angeles Connection case, Makoto takes up an honest job as a mechanic,
                        unknowing of how this ties in to the next con Laurent has planned. Makoto reunites with the rest
                        of the crew, albeit reluctantly, after his boss from his previous job recommends that he be a
                        mechanic for an air sports team. The con focuses on two princes, Sam and Clark Ibrahim, and the
                        Pathfinder Air Race.</p>
                    <p>Sam is the older brother to Clark and the president of the Pathfinder Air Race. Sam and his
                        Brother were princes in a oil rich country. They then came up with a scheme to become rich. This
                        scheme was to buy out the Pathfinder Air Race and rig it in Clark's favor while Sam does
                        backhanded deals and the rigging. In this tournament, Abigail is the pilot for the crew's team
                        but her mental state slowly deteriorates throughout the tournament as she starts remembering her
                        traumatic past.</p>

                        <p>Sam is misogynistic and still adheres to old beliefs that women don't belong in certain
                            fields like air racing. He is shrewd and calculating, easily seeing through Cynthia's guise.
                            He is also cruel, hot-tempered, and is easily provoked by the failures of his underlings,
                            being ready to kill them at the slightest failure.</p>

                        <p>Makoto turns himself in and was sentenced for 2 years in jail. During his sentence, he would
                            be fortunate enough to have the opportunity to learn skills in order to reintegrate into
                            society and earn an honest job.</p>
                        <p>Makoto decided that he wanted to become a mechanic and worked hard during his sentence and
                            became an apprentice, working in Nakanoshima Heavy Industries. This workshop was owned by
                            Shougo Nakanoshima, a mechanic that has a passion for airplanes.</p>
                        <p>Nakanoshima recommended Edamura get a job as mechanic for the up and coming 'Pathfinder Air
                            Race' held in Singapore. It would turn out that the team he's working with is the crew of
                            con-artist, who will be joining the tournament under the name 'Team Confidence'.</p>

                        <p>Laurent was aware of the fact that Lewis had grown a strong hatred towards Sam Ibrahim
                            because of his disgusting actions, so he decided to include him on the scheme to take down
                            Sam. Lewis' wife mentioned how despite him getting crippled because of air racing, he still
                            dreams of racing.</p>

                            stress. She relives her past trauma as she is flying in the race.</p>
                        <p>We learn that her hometown in Baghdad, Iraq was bombed by a fighter jet, who was piloted by
                            non-other than Lewis Mueller. After that point in her life, she was enlisted in a militant
                            group as a child soldier.</p>
                        <p>Abbie's trauma, began transforming into something a lot more violent and made an attempt to
                            exact vengeance on Lewis, before being stopped by Edamura.</p>

                        <p>After Clark and Sam overhears a conversation between Makoto and Cynthia, they were baited
                            into believing that Makoto was a top-notch mechanic who worked for Lewis when he was still
                            racing which intrigued them.</p>
                        <p>They were willing to see just how good of a mechanic Makoto was by assessing his work and
                            seeing the difference it would have on Clark's performance. After they tested the plane,
                            Shi-won Kim a con-artist apart of the scheme informs Sam of an underground casino where they
                            bet on the air races.</p>
                        <p>Sam knowing full well that he rigs his races, he ceases this opportunity to gain more cash,
                            but this whole underground casino was just a ploy operated by the crew to manipulate Sam.

                        <p>After Abigail makes it to the finals, she lets Lewis take part in the final race against
                            Clark. Albeit, hesitantly as she has to entrust the person who killed her parents in this
                            operation. Before the race started, Lewis suddenly apologized to Abigail.</p>
                        <p>During the race, Clark eventually realises that the person he's up against is not Abbie, but
                            Lewis. This fires him up as this was the rematch he was longing for and the intensity of the
                            race elevates to another level. The two of them duke it out, performing wild maneuvers in
                            the air and have an extremely close race.</p>
                        <p>Abigail watches as she clenches onto her old and damaged medal she won from a ballet
                            tournament back in her youth. In this moment, Abbie thinks back to Lewis' apology and
                            forgives Lewis for his actions. The race was extremely close, but Clark came out victorious.
